## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on the loops to create new CSS elements through JavaScript and the logics behind update new elements.

## Optimizations

I would have made the logics more well written, and created new rules in case of User Input a blank value. There is lot of space to improvments in the future, and refactor.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a CRUD application _YEAH!_ Definitely, next time, I should keep an eye out for techniques, or frameworks, that could make my work more optimized.
